      "Answer: We start off by simplifying the ratio $\\frac{192}{80}$ to $\\frac{12}{5}$. The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of sidelengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{12}{5}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$So, our answer is $2+15+5=\\boxed{22}$. If you started off by taking the square root of $\\frac{192}{80}$ directly without simplifying it first, you still get the same answer. $$\\sqrt{\\frac{192}{80}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{192}}{\\sqrt{80}}=\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$\n",

      "Answer: We raise both sides to the fourth power, which is equivalent to squaring twice, in order to get rid of the radicals. The left-hand side becomes $$\\left(\\sqrt{2\\sqrt{t-2}}\\right)^4 = \\left(2\\sqrt{t-2}\\right)^2 = 4 \\cdot (t-2) = 4t-8.$$The right-hand side becomes $\\left(\\sqrt[4]{7-t}\\right)^4 = 7-t$. Setting them equal, $$4t-8 = 7-t \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 5t = 15,$$and $t = \\boxed{3}$.  Checking, we find that this value does indeed satisfy the original equation.\n",

      "\n",
      "$\\frac{192}{80}$ simplifies to $\\frac{12}{5}$\n",

      "$\\sqrt{\\frac{12}{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{5}}$\n",

      "The solution provided is correct. The simplification of the radicals was done properly and the final deduction for the value of t, was right on point. The verification of the solution as valid also adds to the reliability of this response. Good job on your mathematical handling! with the correct answer is: Substituting $\\triangle + q = 59$ into the second equation gives $59 + q = 106$, so $q= 106-59 = 47$.  Substituting $q=47$ into $\\triangle + q =59$ gives $\\triangle + 47 = 59$, so $\\triangle = \\boxed{12}$., please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: \n",
