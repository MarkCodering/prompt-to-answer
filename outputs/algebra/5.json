The calculations were performed correctly and the final answer, which is indeed 2, is correct. The explanation provided is articulate and easy to understand. Thus, the correctness score would be 100 out of 100. No suggestions for revision are necessary. with the correct answer is: Let $a$ be the number of pennies that Alex currently has, and let $b$ be the number of pennies that Bob currently has. If Alex gives Bob a penny, Alex will have $a - 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b + 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have three times as many pennies as Alex has, so $b + 1 = 3(a - 1) = 3a - 3$. If Bob gives Alex a penny, Alex will have $a + 1$ pennies and Bob will have $b - 1$ pennies. Also, Bob will have twice as many pennies as Alex has, so $b - 1 = 2(a + 1) = 2a + 2$.\n\nIf we subtract the second equation from the first, we obtain $2 = a - 5$, so $a = 7$. Plugging this in, we can find that $b = 17$, so Bob has $\\boxed{17}$ pennies., please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: "}]}
