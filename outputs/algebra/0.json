The calculation of the area ratio is incorrect leading to a wrong final answer.

Hence, the sum $a+b+c$ should be 2+15+5 = 22, not 66. with the correct answer is: We start off by simplifying the ratio $\\frac{192}{80}$ to $\\frac{12}{5}$. The area of a square equals the side length squared, so we can get the ratio of sidelengths by taking the square root of the ratio of areas: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{12}{5}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{12}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$So, our answer is $2+15+5=\\boxed{22}$. If you started off by taking the square root of $\\frac{192}{80}$ directly without simplifying it first, you still get the same answer. $$\\sqrt{\\frac{192}{80}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{192}}{\\sqrt{80}}=\\frac{8\\sqrt{3}}{4\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{5}}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{5}.$$, please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: "}]}
