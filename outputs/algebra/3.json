The simplification of the radicals was done properly and the final deduction for the value of t, was right on point. The verification of the solution as valid also adds to the reliability of this response. Good job on your mathematical handling! with the correct answer is: Substituting $\\triangle + q = 59$ into the second equation gives $59 + q = 106$, so $q= 106-59 = 47$.  Substituting $q=47$ into $\\triangle + q =59$ gives $\\triangle + 47 = 59$, so $\\triangle = \\boxed{12}$., please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: "}]}
