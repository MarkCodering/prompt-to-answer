I believe these revisions address the errors and present a clearer and more accurate solution.\n and the supervisor provides the suggestion to correct the method: The provided solution is correct. The calculation for the value of $\\triangle$ has been executed correctly and the derived value of $\\triangle = 12$ is accurate. Consequently, I would award a correctness score of 100. There are no revisions necessary. with the correct answer is: We can have $\\log_{10}100=2$ and $\\log_{10}1000=3$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}100<\\log_{10}579<\\log_{10}1000$, meaning $2<\\log_{10}579<3$.  Thus, the desired sum is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$., please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: "}]}
