Thank you for pointing out these areas for improvement.\n and the supervisor provides the suggestion to correct the method: The correctness score is 100. The provided solution accurately follows the steps of first substituting $x = 5$ into the function $f(x)$, finding $f(5)$ to be 1. It then substitutes this result into the function $t(x)$, resulting in the correct answer of 2. There are no corrections needed. with the correct answer is: Noelle only has to do 1 homework assignment to earn her first point, and the same is true for each of her first five points.  She must then do 2 homework assignments to earn her sixth point, seventh point, and so on, up to her tenth point.  Continuing, we see that Noelle must do a total of \\[1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+2+\\dots+5+5+5+5+5\\] homework assignments to earn 25 points.\n\nThis sum may be rewritten as $5(1+2+3+4+5)=5(15)=\\boxed{75}$., please revise your answer to get a higher correctness score: "}]}
